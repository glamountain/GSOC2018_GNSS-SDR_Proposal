\subsection{Methods}

The additions that need to be made to the GNSS-SDR framework to implement the robust Kalman filter-based carrier synchronization proposed in this document are twofold: First, software for performing carrier synchronization using a Kalman filter-based approach will need to be developed based on standard filter algorithms without robust covariance estimation. Currently, the GNSS-SDR project performs carrier synchronization using a digital DLL/PLL-based architecture, so implementation of even standard filter methodology will involve the development of an entirely new architecture and parallel data pathway for the carrier synchronization portion of the receiver. It is believed that development, integration and testing of the architecture based on the standard Kalman methodology within the GNSS-SDR framework will represent the bulk of effort required for this contribution. Second, once the Kalman filter-based approach is implemented using standard Kalman filter methodology, that software can then be modified to perform robust covariance estimation. This should not be as significant a body of effort as the development of the basic Kalman architecture, but as it constitutes a departure from the established Kalman techniques for performing phase estimation, it will require additional prototyping and performance testing that would not be of as much value for the traditional Kalman methods.

\subsection{Timeline}

We anticipate that some of the prototyping work for the robust covariance estimation methods (e.g. in MATLAB) can be performed in parallel with the development of the Kalman filter architecture within the GNSS-SDR framework. Based on the Phase 1-3 breakdown provided by the Google Summer of Code program, we propose the following goals:

Phase 1, 14-May-2018 to 15-June-2018: Development and integration of standard Kalman filter based methodology into the carrier synchronization portion of the GNSS-SDR datapath, and preliminary results from prototyping the covariance estimation methods.

Phase 2, 15-June-2018 to 13-July-2018: Testing of standard Kalman filter based methodology into the carrier synchronization portion of the GNSS-SDR datapath, and final results from prototyping the covariance estimation methods.

Phase 3, 13-July-2018 to 14-August-2018: Development and integration of robust Kalman filter based methodology with covariance estimation into the carrier synchronization portion of the GNSS-SDR datapath
